# 🎓 Student Course Management System (C++)

This is a console-based C++ application that allows admins and students to manage student-course records with support for creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of entries. It uses file handling with `courses.txt` to store data and a B-Tree structure to organize course IDs for efficient insertion and traversal.

Developed during my internship at **Tequed Labs** as part of a data structures and systems-based learning project.
